NAME: RYAN VALLER


INSTALL INSTR: Going to need to create two csv files: output, output2, output3 for use in the write process of
this initial sprint (sprint1). Also install/import the following modules: sys, csv, pandas, requests and create and
import a secret.py module to store your api key, as personal one is stored remotely via git ignore


DESCRIPTION: This program for the first sprint scrapes the data from imDB's API website, stores it into a variable of
sorts (e.g., dictionary or json) and outputs it into a neat format in a csv file.


MISSING FEATURES: Hopefully no features were missed during the making of this sprint

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: I used 3 files to handle the different portions of this sprint.
