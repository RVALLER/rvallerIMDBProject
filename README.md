INSTALL INSTR: For Sprint 3, make sure each database (movie_api.db & dummy.db) is currently empty before 
the following actions to ensure smooth testing: 1.) Before running Sprint_3.py and 2.) before running 
test_sprint2 & test_sprint3. Make sure all requirements are acquired per requirements.txt and also 
assure that all necessary output files, secret key (yours) is in place. 

DESCRIPTION: This program builds upon the first two sprints that scrapes the data from imDB's API website. The
data included is: top 250 shows, top 250 movies, ratings data for the wheel of time, and top 1,50,150,200.
from that initial data scrape, the most popular movies and tv shows, as well as tables for the biggest
3 upticks and biggest down tick in each respective cat. (movie and tv) and implements various methods 
including sqlite3, output.csv, test modules, pandas, and requests to neatly output the 
api data into the database as instructed. It also uses a dictionary flattener to more easily output the
ratings data into their own unique table in movie_api.db.


MISSING FEATURES: The only potential missing feature for Sprint 3 would be bad path tests for automation testing. 
Still not fully clear how to properly do some of these automated tests to your required parameters.
