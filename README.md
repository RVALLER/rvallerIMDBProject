NAME: RYAN VALLER


INSTALL INSTR: For Sprint 4, Simply open the file labeled 'gui_main.py' and study up on the user manual for ease of GUI
navigation. As with prior Sprints, make sure to run requirements.txt to ensure all proper packages and included software
is installed in virtual env at time of running gui_main.py. The user manual is in the project directory under the guise
"IMDB-DATA_MANUAL_GUI_RVALLER.pdf"

DESCRIPTION: The final (prototype) released in this sprint is a showcase of all the work that led up to this point. In
this sprint, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been added to the project. This GUI ensures ease of access to all
items/data/database info that was created in sprints 1-3. It contains features such as pyqt,pyqt graphs, pyside6
and more. With a bare-bones design, this sleek UI is an effective way to access data.


MISSING FEATURES: Potentially some tests. Only other missing feature would happen if instructions were misinterpreted
However unlikely that case may be.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: Because of some 'technical debt' the 'update button' has a not-so-insignificant amount of buffering
to it. Rest assured, though, it works fine. (Also noted in user manual pdf)
